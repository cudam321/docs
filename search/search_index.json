Some rules that you should follow: Note: This will also be your wallet address, unlike the cryptographic wallet addresses common to Ethereum, NEAR uses human-readable account names as wallet addresses.

This one is important as you need to choose your secured method. Luckily, you can change this after you create an account, but right now you should select the most secure (i.e: Recovery Phrase or Ledger Nano S or X). You can add two other methods after you finish creating an account. Now your screen will present twelve characters and you have to back up this phrase. You can do the following action to backup: Write down several pieces of paper and put them somewhere else safe. Save it into some files on another computer or phone which you only use for security purposes (remember to clean all the virus before putting the seed phrase into it). Make sure you get your seed phrase secure and then you enter one of the random keywords (in this situation is word number 5) to verify that phrase. Now you'll need to verify your new account, there are 2 ways to do this: One-time passcode: Verify your account by confirming the passcode sent via email or phone SMS. Initial Deposit: Verify your account by making your first deposit. This can be done by depositing from an existing account, purchasing with a Credit Card (via Moonpay) or by making a manual deposit from CEXs. You're all done!
